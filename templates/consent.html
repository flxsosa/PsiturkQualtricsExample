                        Dear Participants,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You are being asked to participate in a project being conducted by a research team at Harvard University, under the direction of Dr. Tomer Ullman. We are interested in how people are able to reason quickly and in a commonsense way about the different objects and people they encounter in the world around them. A better understanding of commonsense reasoning has implications for building more intelligent machines that can reason in a more human-like way, lowering risk in different physical situations. During this study, you will be presented with video and pictorial events. To assess your understanding of these displays, you will be asked questions and you will respond by selecting an appropriate response.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The study will last around 20 minutes. Your participation in this study is completely voluntary. You may refuse to participate, or you may choose to withdraw from participation at any time, without penalty or loss of benefit to which you are otherwise entitled. There has been no harm to people involved in this study and there are no risks associated with participation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All information collected from the study will be associated with a randomly generated Mechanical Turk code number or Mechanical Turk Worker ID, which is the only identifying data you will be requested to provide. Unless your profile is set to private, MTurk IDâ€™s can be used to link back to user account. We suggest you set your profile to private. This ID will be changed to Study IDs upon payment. Only researchers associated with this project will have access to the data. In order to make a research transparent to the scientific and broader community our study design and unidentifiable data are made publicly available on Open Science Framework, a network of research materials and collaboration software, but your data will not be in anyway identifiable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We will also provide you with a demographic questionnaire. The form does not include any personal identifying information other than your Mechanical Turk Worker ID. Your contribution to this questionnaire is voluntary; if you choose to provide the requested information, your responses will be confidential. You will be reimbursed at a rate of $10/hr for your participation. You might be requested to provide your Mechanical Turk ID for reimbursement purposes, but these numbers will be deleted immediately after reimbursement. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your participation in our study would be greatly appreciated.
